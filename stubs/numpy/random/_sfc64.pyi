        SFC64(seed=None)
    
        BitGenerator for Chris Doty-Humphrey's Small Fast Chaotic PRNG.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
            A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
            unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
            ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
            `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
            pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
    
        Notes
        -----
        ``SFC64`` is a 256-bit implementation of Chris Doty-Humphrey's Small Fast
        Chaotic PRNG ([1]_). ``SFC64`` has a few different cycles that one might be
        on, depending on the seed; the expected period will be about
        :math:`2^{255}` ([2]_). ``SFC64`` incorporates a 64-bit counter which means
        that the absolute minimum cycle length is :math:`2^{64}` and that distinct
        seeds will not run into each other for at least :math:`2^{64}` iterations.
    
        ``SFC64`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
        doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
        directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
        or similar object that supports low-level access.
    
        **State and Seeding**
    
        The ``SFC64`` state vector consists of 4 unsigned 64-bit values. The last
        is a 64-bit counter that increments by 1 each iteration.
    
        The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate the first
        3 values, then the ``SFC64`` algorithm is iterated a small number of times
        to mix.
    
        **Compatibility Guarantee**
    
        ``SFC64`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed will always produce the same
        random integer stream.
