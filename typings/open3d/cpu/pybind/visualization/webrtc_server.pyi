    Register callback for a data channel message.
    
    When the data channel receives a valid JSON string, the ``class_name`` property
    of the JSON object will be examined and the corresponding callback function will
    be called. The string return value of the callback will be sent back as a reply,
    if it is not empty.
    
    .. note:: Ordering between the message and the reply is not guaranteed, since
       some messages may take longer to process than others. If ordering is important,
       use a unique message id for every message and include it in the reply.
